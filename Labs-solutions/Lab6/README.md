### Task 6.1: Bootstrap the creation of your web server

#### Q611. What happens when you use https://your-load-balancer-url instead of http://your-load-balancer-url ? Why does that happen? How could you fix it?

If we access the load balancer without the security protocol, we will see that our instance is running on AWS. But, if we do include the https protocol in the DNS of our instance, even though we still can access the content of the load balancer but we are warned about the lack of validity of our certificate. This is happening because we have not bought a SSL standard license from any valid provider (a Certificate Authority). The warning is shown below:

If we want to fix this issue we would have to contact a Certificate Authority that reviews our service and allows us securing it with a SSL protocol.


#### Q612. Stop all three EC2 instances and wait aprox. 5 minutes. What happens? Why?

We stoped the EC2 instances:

The first thing that happened after this was that we received an AWS notification that alerted us about the state of the machine and also states that the auto-scaling group will be launched:

![WithHttps](https://github.com/mgmartinezl/CLOUD-COMPUTING-CLASS-2019/blob/master/Labs-solutions/Lab6/launchMail.png)

As a result, 2 more machines started to run in the EC2 console. We also noted that the machines we stopped started to appeared as "terminated", so that only 2 machines are active and running:

#### Q613. Terminate all three EC2 instances and wait aprox. 5 minutes. What happens? Why?

We terminated the EC2 instances:

As a results, all the machines were terminated:

![WithHttps](https://github.com/mgmartinezl/CLOUD-COMPUTING-CLASS-2019/blob/master/Labs-solutions/Lab6/instancesTerminating.png)

Again, we received a notification stating the launch of the auto-scaling group and therefore, two new machines were created and running:

#### Q614. How are you going to end this section regarding the use of AWS resources?

For this lab exercise, we used the micro EC2 instance that is eligible for free trier. Therefore, we do not have associated costs to the usage of this lab. However, for the past sessions we experienced some low charges due to the usage of the nano EC2 instances. Information about billing can be seen as follows:

#### Q615. Create a piece of code (Python or bash) to reproduce the above steps required to launch a new set of web servers with a load balancer. Start using the AMI that you have already created.

```
import boto3
import os

# Initial variables
region_name = 'eu-west-1'
LaunchConfigurationName = 'launch_configuration'
AutoScalingGroupName = 'web-server-auto-scaling-group2'
TopicARN = 'arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:424471540912:gsg-signup-notifications'

# Connection to client - remember to add environment variables
client = boto3.client('autoscaling', region_name, aws_access_key_id=os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
                      aws_secret_access_key=os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'])

# Create launch configuration
client.create_launch_configuration(LaunchConfigurationName=LaunchConfigurationName,
                                   ImageId='ami-05dc3a6ca9ac9f167',
                                   KeyName='keyLab6',

                                   InstanceType='t2.micro')

# Create autoscaling group
client.create_auto_scaling_group(AutoScalingGroupName=AutoScalingGroupName,
                                 AvailabilityZones=['eu-west-1a', 'eu-west-1b'],
                                 LaunchConfigurationName=LaunchConfigurationName,
                                 MinSize=2,
                                 MaxSize=2,

                                 VPCZoneIdentifier='subnet-5345ec09,subnet-e3e19eab',
                                 HealthCheckGracePeriod=300,
                                 HealthCheckType='ELB',
                                 Tags=[
                                     {'Key': 'Project', 'Value': 'ccbda bootstrap'},
                                     {'Key': 'Cost-center', 'Value': 'laboratory'}])

# Add scaling policy
client.put_scaling_policy(AutoScalingGroupName=AutoScalingGroupName,
                          PolicyName='Scale Group Size',
                          PolicyType='TargetTrackingScaling',
                          TargetTrackingConfiguration={
                              'PredefinedMetricSpecification': {
                                  'PredefinedMetricType': 'ASGAverageCPUUtilization'},
                              'TargetValue': 80})

# Add notification via SNS Topic
client.put_notification_configuration(AutoScalingGroupName=AutoScalingGroupName,
                                      NotificationTypes=[
                                          'autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCH',
                                          'autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCH_ERROR',
                                          'autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATE',

                                          'autoscaling:TEST_NOTIFICATION'],
                                      TopicARN=TopicARN)
                                      
```                                      

### Task 6.2: Serverless example

#### Q621. What is the list of events that the above URL triggers? 

The URL is not showing the result of any event because we have not defined the "test" event. However, if we change the URL so that it contains the word "default" instead of "test", the API allows in principle the execution of the GET event. However, in principle we can execute any event (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) by configuring so.

#### Q622. Does the reply of the above URL match what it should be expected? Why?

Yes, as GET is the default event that the HTTP protocol manages. We would have to configure additional steps in order to explicitly able the triggering of the other events.

#### Q623. Explain what happens (actions and parts activated) when you type the URL in your browser to obtain the page updated with the shopping list.

1. Activate the S3 web server, which contains the index.html, the script.js and the styles.css. 
2. This server is calling an endpoint of the Gateway API through the javascript code. In this call, the parameter used is the table name "shopping-list".
3. The Gateway API executes the Lambda function, which executes the GET event by default and a POST when we insert a new element to the database.
4. The Lambda function calls the DynamoDB table we have created.
5. The URL shows the GET output for the "shopping-list" table.

#### Q624. Explain what happens (actions and parts activated) when you type a new item in the New Thing box.

1. Activate the S3 web server, which contains the index.html, the script.js and the styles.css. 
2. This server is calling an endpoint of the Gateway API through the javascript code. In this call, the parameter used is the table name "shopping-list".
3. The Gateway API executes the Lambda function, which executes the POST event to insert a new element to the Dynamo table.

#### Q625. Have you been able to debug the code of the Lambda function? If the answer is yes, check that you are using the root API keys. Erase such keys and create a new testing user with the required permissions.

#### Q626. What are the minimum permissions that the user's API keys needs to execute the Lambda function locally?

#### Q627. Create a piece of code (Python or bash) to reproduce the above steps required to launch a new AWS Lambda function and AWS API gateway.
