#### Q54: Take a couple of screenshots of you S3 and CloudFront consoles to demonstrate that everything worked all right. Commit the changes on your web app, deploy them on Elastic beanstalk and check that it also works fine from there: use Google Chrome and check the origin of the files that you are loading (attach a screen shot similar to the one below):
